# ros2_teleop_twist_web
Simple Web Control Of a ROS2 Robot, using ROS2 Rosbridge

Note this is a simple web control using push buttons to make small robot movements, forwards/backwards and left/right. It is probably too basic to be practically useful; but it does demonstrate how to get a web browser to interact with ROS2 using ROS2 Rosbridge.

# Launch

ros2 launch teleop_twist_web teleop_twist_web_launch.py

To use:

on web browser:
    http://192.168.1.178:8000/

replace the above IP address with the address of the server where you launch teleop_twist_web.
